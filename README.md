# AirFlow_SQLite_Pipeline_RandomUser_API
A data pipeline made using SQLite and the 'randomuser.me' API

This project was part of a course I had taken on AirFlow and using SQLite and the API from the website 'randomuser.me' to create a datapipeline. The processes involved in this pipeline incldue the creation of a SQLite data table (if not exists), checking the randomuser.me API, extracting a user, processing the user by converting them to a Pandas dataframe and storing in a CSV, then storing it in the SQLite database.
